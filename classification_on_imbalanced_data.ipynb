    "## Main Task\n",
    "In the insurance industry, predicting the likelihood of claims is critical for risk assessment and policy pricing. However, insurance claims datasets often exhibit class imbalance, with non-claims outnumbering actual claims. (Classification On A Highly Imbalanced Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imbalanced Data:** refers to a dataset where the classes are not represented equally. In a classification task, this typically means that one class (or a few classes) occurs much more frequently than others. For example, in a binary classification problem, you might have 95% of the data belonging to class A and only 5% to class B.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges of Imbalanced Data:\n",
    "1. **Bias Toward Majority Class:** Standard machine learning algorithms often assume a relatively equal class distribution. When faced with imbalanced data, these algorithms may be biased towards the majority class, leading to poor predictive performance on the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Skewed Performance Metrics:** Traditional metrics like accuracy can be misleading in the context of imbalanced data. For instance, in the previous example, a model that always predicts class A would achieve 95% accuracy but would fail entirely to capture class B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies to Handle Imbalanced Data:\n",
    "#### Resampling Techniques:\n",
    "1. **Oversampling:** Increasing the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating instances or generating synthetic data (e.g., using SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).\n",
    "2. **Undersampling:** Reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset.\n",
    "#### Algorithmic Solutions:\n",
    "1. **Weighted Loss Functions:** Modify the loss function to give more importance to the minority class, which can help the model to pay more attention to it during training.\n",
    "2. **Ensemble Methods:** Methods like Random Forest or Boosting can be adjusted to handle imbalanced data, such as by using balanced random forests or boosting with class weights.\n",
    "3. **Anomaly Detection Techniques:** In cases where the minority class is extremely rare, anomaly detection methods might be more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "The dataset has the following features:\n",
    "1. policy_id: Unique identifier for the insurance policy.\n",
    "2. subscription_length: The duration for which the insurance policy is active.\n",
    "3. customer_age: Age of the insurance policyholder, which can influence the likelihood of claims.\n",
    "4. vehicle_age: Age of the vehicle insured, which may affect the probability of claims due to factors like wear and tear.\n",
    "5. model: The model of the vehicle, which could impact the claim frequency due to model-specific characteristics.\n",
    "6. fuel_type: Type of fuel the vehicle uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG), which might influence the risk profile and claim likelihood.\n",
    "7. max_torque, max_power: Engine performance characteristics that could relate to the vehicle’s mechanical condition and claim risks.\n",
    "8. engine_type: The type of engine, which might have implications for maintenance and claim rates.\n",
    "9. displacement, cylinder: Specifications related to the engine size and construction, affecting the vehicle’s performance and potentially its claim history.\n",
    "10. region_code: The code representing the geographical region of the policyholder, as claim patterns can vary regionally.\n",
    "11. region_density: Population density of the policyholder’s region, which could correlate with accident and claim frequencies.\n",
    "12. airbags: The number of airbags in the vehicle, indicating safety level which can influence claim probability.\n",
    "13. is_esc (Electronic Stability Control), is_adjustable_steering, is_tpms (Tire Pressure Monitoring System): Features that enhance vehicle safety and could potentially reduce the likelihood of claims.\n",
    "14. is_parking_sensors, is_parking_camera: Parking aids that might affect the probability of making a claim, especially in urban areas.\n",
    "15. rear_brakes_type: Type of rear brakes, which could be related to the vehicle’s stopping capability and safety.\n",
    "Features like steering_type, turning_radius, length, width, gross_weight, and various other binary indicators (Yes/No) for specific vehicle amenities and safety features, which together build a profile of the vehicle’s characteristics and its associated risk factors.\n",
    "16. claim_status: Indicates whether a claim was made (1) or not (0), which is the dependent variable the model aims to predict."
