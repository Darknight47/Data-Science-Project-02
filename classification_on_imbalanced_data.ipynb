    "Classification On A Highly Imbalanced Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imbalanced Data:** refers to a dataset where the classes are not represented equally. In a classification task, this typically means that one class (or a few classes) occurs much more frequently than others. For example, in a binary classification problem, you might have 95% of the data belonging to class A and only 5% to class B.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges of Imbalanced Data:\n",
    "1. **Bias Toward Majority Class:** Standard machine learning algorithms often assume a relatively equal class distribution. When faced with imbalanced data, these algorithms may be biased towards the majority class, leading to poor predictive performance on the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Skewed Performance Metrics:** Traditional metrics like accuracy can be misleading in the context of imbalanced data. For instance, in the previous example, a model that always predicts class A would achieve 95% accuracy but would fail entirely to capture class B.\n",
