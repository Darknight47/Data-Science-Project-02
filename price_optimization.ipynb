    "## Main Goal\n",
    "The goal is to develop a dynamic pricing model that optimizes the prices of items to maximize revenue while remaining competitive in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This involves:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyzing the current pricing strategy and its impact on sales and revenue.\n",
    "2. Comparing our pricing strategy with that of the competition to identify gaps and opportunities.\n",
    "3. Developing a dynamic pricing model that adjusts prices based on factors such as competitor pricing, demand elasticity, and market trends.\n",
    "4. Implementing and simulating the dynamic pricing model to compare its performance against the existing pricing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "The given dataset contains pricing information for various items sold at a retail store and their corresponding prices at competing stores. The dataset includes the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fiscal_Week_Id**: The fiscal week identifier.\n",
    "2. **Store_Id**: The store identifier.\n",
    "3. **Item_Id**: The item identifier.\n",
    "4. **Price**: The price of the item at our store.\n",
    "5. **Item_Quantity**: The quantity of the item sold.\n",
    "6. **Sales_Amount_No_Discount**: Sales amount without discount.\n",
    "7. **Sales_Amount**: Sales amount after discounts.\n",
    "8. **Competition_Price**: The price of the item at a competing store."
