### Music Recommendation System 01 (music_recommendation)
The goal is to create a recommendation system that can suggest relevant songs to user based on their musical interest, known and liked songs, or general preferences.  
A recommendation system analyzes the characteristics of songs, such as genre, tempo, energy, and other audio features, and groups them into clusters. These clusters represent groups of songs that share similar attributes.

### Music Recommendation System 02 (music_recommendation02)
The goal is to create a recommendation system that can suggest relevant songs to user based on their musical interest, known and liked songs, or general preferences by using two different approaches, **content-based** and **hybrid**!  
**The content-based approach** is based on the idea that a user's preferences can be predicted based on their previous interactions with items, such as their viewing and purchasing history!  
**The hybrid approach** aims to provide more personalized and relevant recommendations by considering both the content similarity of songs and their weighted popularity.
