# Data Science Projects 02

## Project One: Predicting popularity of a music (music_popularity_prediction)
The goal is to estimate the popularity of music tracks based on their audio features.  
Predicting the popularity of music can help music streaming platforms understand user preferences, optimize playlists and enhance recommendation systems to improve
user engagement and satisfaction.

## Project Two: Recommendation System (music_recommendation)

Make recommendations based on similar users
Find the products that the top similar users have purchased.  
Filter out the products that the target user has already purchased.  
Recommend the remaining products to the target user, prioritizing those that were purchased by more of their similar users or had higher purchase amounts.  

## Project Four: Purchase Prediction (purchase_prediction)
Predict if a user will purchase a product or not!

## Project Five: Classification on highly imbalanced data (classification_on_imbalanced_data)
In the insurance industry, predicting the likelihood of claims is critical for risk assessment and policy pricing. However, insurance claims datasets often exhibit class imbalance, with non-claims outnumbering actual claims. 

## Project Six: Steam Game Recommendation
Building a Game Recommendation System with Steam Platform Data!
