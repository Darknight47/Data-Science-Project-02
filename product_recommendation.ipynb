    "The system aims to recommend products to a user by identifying products that similar users (with similar purchase behaviors) have interacted with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Product ID** is the second critical piece because the system needs to recommend items. Each product must have a unique identifier so that the system can track which products users have interacted with.  \n",
    "The goal is to find patterns of product interactions, like which products are frequently bought together or liked by similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Purchase** is the actual interaction between users and products. This represents implicit feedback because a purchase implies a level of preference, but it’s not as direct as a rating system (where users rate items from 1 to 5, for example).  \n",
    "In collaborative filtering, this interaction data (purchase amounts) is used to find similar users (or products). Users with similar interaction patterns are grouped together, and recommendations are made based on these patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The other features in your dataset, like gender, age, occupation, and city, are demographic or categorical attributes.  \n",
